# Open CV. Face detection.

## Introduction

The task of identifying faces in a photo is perhaps the most common task in computer vision. A set of convenient functions for this is in the OpenCV library. In this project, I will try to implement finding the face in the image and video.

## Example of work

## Installation the project with CMake
- Ð¡lone the current repository
- Go into the cloned repository
- Create a folder "sln"
- Go into the newly created folder
- Create a folder "vs19"
- Go into the newly created folder
- In cmd enter the command: "cmake ..\..\"
- In the project itself, include the OpenCV library
